== File Commands: echo, mv, cp, rm, nano

=== Powerful Ways To Work With Files

In _Chapter 2. Core Commands_, we see how easy it is to change into any directory (with the appropriate permission) and to view our files.  So let's now explore how easy it is to work with files directly on the command line.  In the coming sections, we'll learn how to use the `+echo+` command to quickly create a file.  This is one of those magical tricks that makes the command line so powerful!  We'll then effortlessly append to that newly-created file, and will see just how simple command line file handling is.  By highlighting these common command patterns, we'll learn how they are made possible with the concept of _redirection_, and other useful constructs in Unix-like operating systems.  We'll also explore how to use the `+echo+` command to display text directly to the terminal screen, demonstrating the concepts of _standard input_, _output_, and _error_.  This let's us then consider the commands for moving and renaming files, copying them, editing them, and of course deleting them.  Finally, in order to edit existing files directly in the terminal, we'll also check out a simple command called `+nano+` that provides us with just the right amount of lightweight editing tools.  Let's have a look!

=== The echo Command--Easily Creating Files

The `+echo+` command is a simple command which really illustrates the ideas of _inputs_ and _outputs_ on the command line.  We'll discuss why it is called "echo" shortly, but let's first highlight the best part about this command--the fact that you can instantly create a file with it!  We'll start with _Example 28_, where we use the `+echo+` command to write a sentence into a file called `+herding-cats.txt+` on Windows.  If you're on macOS or Linux, give it a try from your home directory too.

CAUTION: Note that creating files with the `+echo+` command will immediately overwrite a file if it exists, so be careful with this command.

----

You just created your first real file from the command line!  We now have a file called `+herding-cats.txt+` in our home directory.  Let's take a minute to understand what is happening here.

We first see the `+echo+` command followed by our seven-word sentence{emdash}"Our cat Luna is the ranch manager."  This means that seven arguments are passed to the `+echo+` command (with the period as part of the seventh argument).  Then, the `+>+` (greater-than) sign is telling the shell to send the output of the `+echo+` command into a file named `+herding-cats.txt+`, or create the file if it does not exist.  This is really powerful!  The `+>+` (greater-than) sign is acting as a _redirect operator_, which we will discuss below.  If you then open the `+herding-cats.txt+` file using any common text editor application such as _TextEdit_ on macOS, _Text Editor_ on Linux, or _Notepad_ on Windows, you'll see the contents of the file, as shown in _Figure 25_.

===  Redirection, Standard Input, Output, and Error

In Unix-like operating systems, there is the concept of _redirection_ that allows us to send the output of a command to other destinations, including into a file.  As we can see, this is super helpful!  There are a few characters that we use in our shell commands to enable this, and they are known as _redirect operators_.  We've already seen that the `+>+` (greater-than) sign will redirect the command output into a file specified on the right side of the operator, and it will create the file if it doesn't already exist.  You may be asking--What if you've already written something to a file, and you want to add to the file instead of overwrite it?  We have the magic!  A `+>>+` (double greater-than) sign acts as a redirect operator, but appends to the file instead.  Let's give that a try! _Example 29_ shows the append operator.

.Using the `+echo+` command to append output to a file on Windows WSL.

----

image::chapter-03-windows-echo-and-file-appending.png[title="Viewing the appended herding-cats.txt file using a graphical text editor on Windows.",pdfwidth=100%]

Perfect, we now understand how easily redirection can be used to create, overwrite, or append to files, and that the command syntax is very simple.  But what happens when we issue this same command, but without any redirection?  Let's try it, this time on macOS, as shown in _Example 30_.

.Using the `+echo+` command to display text in the terminal window on macOS.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@ophir ~ % echo Our cat Luna is the ranch manager.
Our cat Luna is the ranch manager.
----

Well that is very straight-forward!  We're echo-ing whatever we type as arguments to the command in order to display it as output in the terminal window.  In this case we are passing those same seven arguments to the command.  Let's also run it on Linux, but this time with quotes, seen in _Example 31_.

.Using the `+echo+` command to display quoted text in the terminal window on Linux.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@nuthatch:~$ echo 'Our cat Luna is the ranch manager.'
Our cat Luna is the ranch manager.
----

Hah, interesting!  We get the same output.  When we issued this second command with quotes, the shell interprets the text as a single _string_ argument being passed to the `+echo+` command.

NOTE: In computer programming, a sequence of text-based characters is referred to as a _string_.  It can include letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces, symbols, etc., and is treated as a single unit.

We see in the previous examples that the `+echo+` command sends output to the terminal window, which is very useful in scripts when you want to display progress as the script runs.{empty}footnote:[Commands like those we are learning about can be written into shell scripts, which are files that can be run like programs from the command line.  They are often named similar to `+myscript.sh+` where the `+.sh+` file ending indicates that the file uses the shell programming language.]  This is the reason why the command is named `+echo+`, but we are now aware of how powerful it is when combined with redirection.   

Looking at the manual pages for the `+echo+` command on macOS and Linux, they differ slightly.  They state "Write arguments to the standard output.", and "Display a line of text.", respectively.  Have a look at the manual page to get a feeling for the command.  But what is the _standard output_?

When you open a terminal window and the shell interpreter starts up, it creates a few resources that are called _file descriptors_, which help with input and output operations.  These include _standard input_, _standard output_, and _standard error_.  As you can see, the terminal window itself acts as the device where the shell sends standard output (meaning the default output location).  If you make a mistake when typing your command, the messages that get written to standard error also show up in the terminal window by default.  We will discuss the idea of standard input in more detail shortly, but think of what you type on your keyboard as an example of standard input for the shell interpreter.  Just know that these mechanisms represent the input source, output destination, and error destination when issuing a command.

NOTE: You will often see these three file descriptors written as _stdin_, _stdout_, and _stderr_ respectively.

We can visualize a typical flow of information on the command line as inputs to a _process_ and the outputs of that process, shown in _Figure 26_.  This diagram illustrates the flow of information as inputs and outputs whenever you issue a command.

image::chapter-03-shell-input-and-output.svg[title="Visualizing inputs and outputs when issuing commands in an interactive terminal shell.  Standard input from a keyboard is processed, and is sent by default to the terminal window as standard output and standard error.  With redirection, the output can be redirected into a file.",pdfwidth=100%]

We now have a solid understanding of the `+echo+` command and how to use redirection on the command line to quickly create or append to a file.  We also see that the standard input, standard output, and standard error file descriptors help with input and output operations on the command line, and that the terminal iteself acts as both the standard output and standard error destination.  Let's now focus on working with the file that we created on the command line, to highlight how we can effortlessly move the file, copy it,and delete it.

=== The mv Command--Renaming and Relocating Files

The `+mv+` command is part of a suite of file handling commands that allows us to move a file from one location to another in the file system.  If you use the `+mv+` command to move the file into the same directory but with a different name, you are effectively just renaming the file.  Let's try this with our newly-created `+herding-cats.txt+` file.  _Example 32_ demonstrates moving a file.

.Using the `+mv+` command to rename a file on Linux.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@nuthatch:~$ mv herding-cats.txt ranch-manager.txt  <1>
chris@nuthatch:~$ ls -tr <2>

Templates  Desktop    Pictures         daily-data.csv
Public     Documents  yearly-data.csv  ranch-manager.txt
----
<1> Move `+herding-cats.txt+` to `ranch-manager.txt`.
<2> List the files in reverse chronological order to show the renamed file.

Excellent!  That is a quick way to rename a file!  Also notice that you can use tab completion when typing the `+herding-cats.txt+` file name to save you from typing it out completely.  Just type `+herd+` followed by the kbd:[Tab] key, and the file name will instantly fill in for you on the command line!  Tab completion is super helpful!  You then just need to type your destination file name.

We now see a the `+ranch-manager.txt+` file, and can open it in a text editor application, showing that the contents are the same as the `+herding-cats.txt+` file, as shown in _Figure 27_.

image::chapter-03-linux-move-file.png[title="Viewing the contents of the `+ranch-manager.txt+` file on Linux.",pdfwidth=100%]

To build on our familiarity of the `+mv+` command, let's also move multiple files at the same time.  In this example, we will first practice with the echo command to create two more files, and then move our three files into the `+Desktop+` directory.  On Windows, be sure to change directories into your Windows home directory where your `+Desktop+` directory is.  _Example 33_ shows how to move multiple files.

<2> Create a third file.
<3> Move the three files into the Desktop directory.
<4> List the files in the `+Desktop+` directory 

CAUTION: Using the `+mv+` command will overwrite any file with the same name in the destination directory, so be careful with this command.

It is important to note that the `+mv+` command is equally as powerful as the `+echo+` command coupled with redirection.  If you are moving a file to another directory with the same file name, it will overwrite the file, no questions asked!  To be more cautious with this command, you can use the `+-i+` or `+--interactive+` options, which tells the `+mv+` command to prompt you for confirmation if it will end up overwriting an existing file.  Have a look at the manual page for the details and options for the `+mv+` command.  _Example 34_ shows how to move a file with the interactive option.

.Using the `+mv+` command interactively to avoid overwriting an existing file on Linux.

chris@nuthatch:~/Desktop$
----
<1> Answering `+n+` or `+no+` will stop the `+mv+` command.  Answering `+y+` or `+yes+` will continue with the command.

Now that we know how to rename and move files, let's turn our attention to copying files, which is also very fast via the command line.

=== The cp Command--Copying Files

In order to copy a file, we use the `+cp+` command, and yes, it is as simple as it sounds.  We copy one source file name to a destination file name, and _Example 35_ shows the simple syntax.

.Using the `+cp+` command to copy a file on Linux.

----
chris@nuthatch:~$ cd Desktop/
chris@nuthatch:~/Desktop$ cp ranch-manager.txt ranch-manager-4.txt <1>
chris@nuthatch:~/Desktop$ ls -tr
ranch-manager.txt    ranch-manager-2.txt
ranch-manager-3.txt  ranch-manager-4.txt
----
<1> Copy the source file name to a destination file name

It's really that easy!  And like the `+mv+` command, there is also a `+-i+` interactive option to insure you are aware of overwriting any destination files because the `+cp+` command will otherwise immediately copy the file.  Very powerful!  In _Example 36_, we copy multiple files to another directory in order to create a backup of the files, and we do this interactively with a multi-line command to keep it tidy.

CAUTION: The `+cp+` command is just as powerful as the `+mv+` command, and will overwrite any existing destination file names, so be careful with this command, and use the `+-i+` option to prompt before overwriting files.

.Using the `+cp+` command to interactively copy multiple files on Linux.

ranch-manager-4.txt  ranch-manager-2.txt
----
<1> Since the files didn't exist in the `+~/Downloads+` directory, we are not prompted about overwrites.

Of course, there may be situations where the destination directory that you are copying to doesn't exist.  In this case, the `+cp+` command will print an error message to standard error, meaning it will show you in the terminal.  _Example 37_ shows a typical error when the destination directory is missing.

----
<1> The shell lets you know the `+Backups+` directory doesn't exist

In _Chapter 4. Folder Commands_ we will learn how to create a directory via the command line, which will solve our issue shown in _Example 37_, but just know that a destination directory needs to exist when copying multiple files.  Now, there is a curious edge-case that may happen when copying a single file to another directory when the directory doesn't exist.  Let's demonstrate this in _Example 38_.

.Using the `+cp+` command to copy a file to a directory on Linux.  The result is a new file.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@nuthatch:~/Desktop$ cp ranch-manager.txt ~/Backups
chris@nuthatch:~/Desktop$ ls -lh ~/Backups
-rw-rw-r-- 1 chris chris 54 Feb  2 14:52 /home/chris/Backups  <1>
----
<1> A file called `+Backups+` is created in the home directory

Wait, what happened?  When the directory doesn't exist while copying a single file, the shell interprets the `+cp+` command as a file-to-file copy, rather than a file-to-directory copy!  While our intention was to create a backup of the file in the `+Backups+` directory in our home directory, it instead just created a file called `+Backups+`.  This just shows how the command line will do exactly what you tell it, even when you may have had a different intention!

Speaking of intention, let's be very intentional in the next section on removing files, because the `+rm+` command is no joke!

=== The rm Command--Deleting Files

In this chapter we have learned how to create, move, and copy files thus far, and inevitably we will want to quickly and concisely remove files when we make a mistake, or when we just want to create more space for storage.  The `+rm+` command is your friend!  And like the `+echo+`, `+mv+`, and `+cp+` commands, it will dutifully delete whatever you tell it to delete, no questions asked.  Thankfully, the `+rm+` command also has the `+-i+` and `+--interactive+` options available to you, which certainly generates some peace of mind.  Go ahead and have a look at the manual page for the `+rm+` command to get a sense of the syntax, but it is mighty easy, as we can see in _Example 39_.

CAUTION: The `+rm+` command is also very powerful, and will immediately delete the files you provide as arguments.  There is no concept of a _Trash_ can or _Recycle Bin_, so be careful with this command, and make it a habit to use the `+-i+` option to prompt before deleting files.

Super easy!  There are many times that we download huge files from the Internet that we no longer need, or perhaps it was the wrong file afterall.  We may have thousands of camera image files, or huge video files that need to be deleted.  With a bit of mindfulness, the `+rm+` command can make your life much easier when it comes to cleaning up unwanted files quickly.  In _Chapter 4. Folder Commands_, we will see how we can remove directories as well with the `+rmdir+` command, but the `+-r+` option for the `+rm+` command will do the same.  To keep it simple here, we'll address folder removal in the next chapter.

TIP: While we have organized the `+mv+`, `+cp+`, and `+rm+` commands in this chapter called _File Commands_, they can also be used with folders, which we will show in _Chapter 4. Folder Commands_.

You are likely seeing a common pattern with each of these commands that we use to manage files--they work equally well on multiple files as they do on a single file.  This is no different when deleting files, and _Example 40_ just demonstrates how to remove multiple files quickly.  Remember from our earlier examples that you can always use tab completion to quickly build a list of files to delete.  As a refresher, just type a few of the beginning characters of a file name and then press the kbd:[Tab] key to let the shell complete the file name for you.  So efficient!

----

Notice the interactive option confirms the removal of each file individually.  This works for a few files, but is untenable for hundreds or thousands of files.  In these cases, double check your command is correct, and forego the `+-i+` interactive option, and your files will be deleted instantly.  I'm sure you're wondering{emdash} _Do I have to type out my thousands of file names in order to delete them?_  Definitely not!  In _Chapter 4. Folder Commands_, we will explore the concept of _expansion_ on the command line, where we can use wildcard characters and other tricks that allow us to use a pattern (for example, all files ending in `+.jpg+`) to create a list to delete, copy, or move.  For now, let's round out our file handling commands and learn how to edit files directly in a terminal window using the `+nano+` command.

=== The nano Command--Creating and Editing Files

At the beginning of this chapter we familiarized ourselves with the `+echo+` command and used redirection operators to create, overwrite, and append to a file.  This is great for quick file work, or for appending progress lines to a file, and similar lightweight work.  However, it's nice to have more flexibility while writing, particularly if you are writing a document or editing a configuration file on a remote server.  This is where common editor commands like `+nano+` shine!  While most of the time it is easiest to use a graphical text editor such as TextEdit on macOS, Text Editor on Linux, or Notepad on Windows, there are sitations where a terminal-based editor like `+nano+` is a very helpful tool.  Let's explore the `+nano+` command first by editing our `+ranch-manager.txt+` file that remains in our `+Desktop+` directory.  _Example 41_ shows how to open a file with the `+nano+` command.


NOTE: While the `+nano+` command is available on macOS, Linux, and Windows WSL, the macOS version currently is an alias to the `+pico+` command.  Typing `+nano+` on macOS will therefore open the `+pico+` editor.

----
chris@nuthatch:~$ cd Desktop

----

By just passing the file name as an argument to the `+nano+` command and pressing the kbd:[Return] key, we are presented with an editor view that fills the terminal window.  Give this a try!  We will walk through the steps of how to edit a file with `+nano+`.  _Figure 28_ shows an example of editing a file.

image::chapter-03-linux-nano-editor.png[title="Opening the `+ranch-manager.txt+` file using the `+nano+` command.",pdfwidth=100%]

You'll see that our terminal window turns into a small editor with a dark header section at the top, and a menu of key combinations in the footer section at the bottom.  The blank space in the middle is where you write.  We are placed on the first line of the file, and we can just start typing!  Editing is that easy, and moving the cursor is intuitive with the four arrow keys on your keyboard{emdash}kbd:[&nbsp;◀&nbsp;] (left arrow), the kbd:[&nbsp;▶&nbsp;] (right arrow), the kbd:[&nbsp;▲&nbsp;] (up arrow), and the kbd:[&nbsp;▼&nbsp;] (down arrow).  After adding a couple of lines to the text file, let's save the file.  To do so, let's familiarize ourselves with the menu at the bottom of the editor.  Depending on how wide your terminal window is, you will see two rows of menu item shortcuts with a key combination next to the label.  The `+^+` (caret) symbol is shorthand for the kbd:[Control] key, and is used in combination with another letter, number, or symbol to do things like save the file, search in the file, cut, paste, etc.  So in our case, we'll press `^O` (kbd:[Control]+kbd:[O]) to "Write Out" the file (meaning save it to disk).  You can use lowercase or uppercase letters with these key combinations.  _Figure 29_ shows this menu item in progress.  Try it yourself!

image::chapter-03-linux-nano-save-file.png[title="Saving a file using the `+nano+` `+^O+` menu item (kbd:[Control]+kbd:[O]) key combination.",pdfwidth=100%]

The editor will prompt you to confirm the file name you want to save to, defaulting to the current file name.  Just pressing the kbd:[Return] key will save the file.  It's that easy!  We've now edited our first file via the command line!

To orient ourselves more with the menu for the `+nano+` and `+pico+` commands, notice that some menu items begin with an `+M-+` (M and dash characters), followed by another character.  This is shorthand for the kbd:[Meta] key on your keyboard, which on modern computers is mapped to the kbd:[Esc] (escape) key.  In the `+nano+` editor, you double press the kbd:[Esc] key (Escape key twice) followed by the letter for the menu item. That's a bit obscure, but once you understand it, it is easy to use.  Let's clarify this with an example using the _Undo_ menu item, which is labeled with a `+M-U+`.  Go ahead and delete a line of text using the `^K` (kbd:[Control]+ kbd:[K]) key combination.  Then, press the kbd:[Esc] (Escape) key twice, followed by the letter `+K+`.  The line you deleted should show back up in the file because of this "undo" action.

If your terminal window is not very wide, some of the menu item key combinations in the lower window will be hidden, as is the case in _Figure 29_.  You can always use the `+^G+` (kbd:[Control]+ kbd:[G]) combination to show the help menu for the `+nano+` command.  The help menu also uses the keyboard arrow keys to scroll.  When you are finished using the editor, type `+^X+` (kbd:[Control]+ kbd:[X]) to exit the `+nano+` editor and get back to your command prompt.

==== Redirecting a here-document

Now that you are familiar with editing a file using `+nano+`, let's explore one more way of using the `+nano+` command that builds on our knowledge of using redirection operators from earlier in the chapter.  In this case, let's say we want to begin writing a document on the command line, and redirect the text into the `+nano+` command for further editing.  This is a fun edge case, and it illustrates a command line concept called a _here-document_.  _Example 42_ shows how to create a _here-document_ and redirect it into the `+nano+` editor for further editing.

.Redirecting a here-document on the command line into the `+nano+` editor on Linux.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@nuthatch:~$ nano - << EOF
> Our cat Luna woke us up at 5 am.
> She's an early riser.
> Thanks Luna. :)
> EOF
----

Wow, that's a curious one!  Let's break this down.  We first have the `+nano+` command with a single `+-+` (dash) argument.  This is a `+nano+` option to read from the standard input, meaning anything that is typed on the keyboard.  The `+<<+` (double less-than) operator is redirecting what is called a _here-document_ (anything typed on the command line) until it encounters an `+EOF+` token (meaning end-of-file).  The two `+EOF+` tokens act as bookends to our here-document, and once we type the second `+EOF+` followed by the kbd:[Return] key, everything we type will be passed into the `+nano+` editor.  Now that is some magic!  

NOTE: Similar to a multi-line command, the shell places `+>+` (greater-than) signs on the left of the terminal to indicate you are still typing a here-document.  Note that `+zsh+` on macOS will add a `+heredoc>+` indicator.

The result of our finished command is shown in _Figure 30_, where we can continue to edit the document in the `+nano+` editor.

image::chapter-03-linux-nano-here-document.png[title="Continuing to edit a here-document passed into the `+nano+` command editor.", pdfwidth=100%]

Notice that the `+nano+` command read the three lines from _stdin_, and created a new in-memory buffer for our file, but the file is not saved to disk yet.  We can edit the file and save it normally from here.  Also note that the `+EOF+` tokens that act as beginning and ending delimiters to our here-document can be any single word, and `+EOF+` is just used as a convention.  If we wanted, we could use `+LunaIsHungry+` twice as a token to bookend our document.  Feed the cat!

This wraps up our mini-journey with the `+nano+` command and editing via the command line.  It's also good to be aware that there are other very popular command line editors, such as `+vi+` (or `+vim+`) and `+emacs+`.  Both are very powerful, so feel free to explore them as you build your command line skills.  Onward!

=== Command Line File Handling is Awesome!

We have really made awesome progress in our command line journey by exploring the file handling commands that build on top of the core commands we learned in the last chapter.  We are now familiar with easily creating files with the `+echo+` command via the handy command line concept of redirection.  We can magically append to a file, or overwrite a file, depending on our needs.  So powerful!  We also understand that the special file descriptors called standard input, standard output, and standard error are available to us as the default locations of data flow on the command line (from the keyboard to the terminal, or optionally redirected).  This is amazing stuff!  As we have files to work with, we are now fully acquainted with copying (`+cp+`), moving (`+mv+`), and deleting (`+rm+`) files--everyday tasks that can be accomplished extremely quickly from the command line.  Likewise, we have a solid understanding of how to edit a text file directly within the terminal application using the `+nano+` command.  We now understand the concept of a here-document, and can redirect text into a command that can read from standard input.  Seriously clever! All of these file handling skills allow us to manage files on servers around the world, or efficiently work with our own files locally.  These commands work in concert with our core commands discussed earlier, and with the folder-oriented commands in _Chapter 4. Folder Commands_.  See you there!
