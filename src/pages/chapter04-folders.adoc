== Folder Commands: mkdir, rmdir, du

=== Lightning Fast Folder Management

Everything we create on a computer involves a folder in one way or another.  It is the quintessential means of organizing everything we store digitally.  In the previous chapters we have changed into directories using the `+cd+` command, listed directory contents using the `+ls+` command, and created files inside of directories with the `+echo+` and `+nano+` commands.  We've made incredible progress!  In this chapter, we will build our foundation even further by exploring the commands needed to manage directories.  In particular, we will use the `+mkdir+` command to make new directories, and the `+rmdir+` command to remove them.  We'll also explore the `+du+` command, which gives us a powerful tool to understand our disk usage, and where all of those huge files are that are taking up storage space on our computers.  Given our previous experience with managing files, we will see that these directory-level commands are just as easy to use, and are just as powerful!  In fact, we'll look at an interesting command line concept called _expansion_, which allows us to use special bracketing characters to generate directory or filenames, and wildcard characters to match file and directory name patterns.  These techniques make managing files and directories lightning fast, which is part of the magic of the command line.  We'll also revisit the `+cp+`, `+mv+`, and `+rm+` commands that we learned in _Chapter 3. File Commands_, because they are equally useful for directories!  Let's get organized!

=== The mkdir Command--Creating Directories

Let's jump right in because it doesn't get any easier to create a directory than with the `+mkdir+` command.  The synopsis in the manual page says it all{emdash} "make directories"!  _Example 43_ shows the simplest use of the `+mkdir+` command.

Public		Documents	Downloads	Pictures	Photography
----

That's it!  We've made our first directory called `+Photography+`, and because our current directory is our home directory, we see the `+Photography+` directory gets created right where we specified using a relative directory path.  But let's think a bit about how we need to get organized.  Let's say we have many hundreds of photos on our camera that we just imported into a single directory, and we want to categorize them by location and by date so we can work on them as daily shoots.  If we know the locations and the dates, we could begin to create our directory structure by adding the `+-p+` option to the `+mkdir+` command, which causes it to create intermediate subdirectories if they do not exist.  _Example 44_ demonstrates making a hierarchy of directories using a single command.

----

With a one-line command, we have now created five more directories inside our `+Photography+` directory.  So easy!  _Figure 32_ shows the result using a Finder window on macOS.

image::chapter-04-macos-make-directories.png[title="Showing the results of creating a directory hierarchy with the `+mkdir+` command on macOS.", pdfwidth=100%]

This is a great example of how fast a command can be in accomplishing a lot of work.  However, what if you have photography shoots at dozens of locations and dates, and need to create all of the yearly, monthly, and daily sub-folders for those sessions?  We have the magic!  In the next section, let's explore the concept of command line expansion, and how it will help us get the job done quickly.

=== Expansion--Powerful Techniques To Speed Up Your Commands

The terminal shell gives us a number of shorthand techniques to generate file and directory paths, and they generally fall under the topic of _expansion_.  To understand expansion, let's first review a type of expansion that we have already covered{emdash} _tilde expansion_.  We understand that a `+~+` (tilde) sign on the command line signifies "the user's home directory".  So if we type `+cd ~+`, the command expands to be `+cd /Users/<your-username>+` on macOS or `+/home/<your-username>+` on Linux and WSL.  Likewise, using `+~venus+` on the command line means "the username _venus_' home directory", which expands to `+/Users/venus+` or `/home/venus`, depending on the operating system. So expansion generally gives us shorthand syntax that expands to longer file or directory paths.  So let's first explore the concept of _brace expansion_ to help us with our photo organization project from above.

==== Brace expansion

Brace expansion allows us to define either a list or a sequence in our file or directory paths, and we'll cover both scenarios here.  Let's first explore brace expansion with a list.  The word _brace_ refers to the `+{}+` (curly brace) symbols that are used to bracket phrases or other content.  In our photography project, we have photos from multiple locations that we need to organize, and on multiple dates.  Let's first create the locations in the directory structure using brace expansion.  _Example 45_ demonstrates brace expansion by creating directories for four US states where the photo shoots took place in our existing `+Photography+` directory.

.Using a list brace expansion with the `+mkdir+` command on macOS.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@ophir ~ % mkdir -p Photography/Shoots/{Arizona,Colorado,New-Mexico,Utah}
----

Wow!  In a single command, we just created four directories within the `+Shoots+` subdirectory of our `+Photography+` directory.  Let's break this down.  Using the curly braces as the cue to the shell that we are going to use expansion, we provide a comma-separated list of directory names that we want to create.  These are expanded in the shelll to represent the following four paths:

- `+Photography/Shoots/Arizona+`
- `+Photography/Shoots/Colorado+`
- `+Photography/Shoots/New-Mexico+`
- `+Photography/Shoots/Utah+`

Each path is passed as an argument to the `+mkdir+` command to create these directories.  And notice that while we are asking it to create the `+Utah+` folder in this command, the `+-p+` option will create directories that don't exist already, so it is skipped.  Very convenient!  _Figure 33_ shows the results of our command.

image::chapter-04-macos-list-brace-expansion-results.png[title="Showing the results of creating a directory hierarchy with brace expansion on macOS.", pdfwidth=100%]

Let's now continue with building our directory structure by generating folders for the dates of the photo shoots.  In _Example 44_ we created a directory structure for the photo shoot on July 4, 2024 in Utah, represented by the `+Photography/Shoots/Utah/2024/07/04+` directory path.  Assuming we have had photo shoots over the last five years in our four locations on different days of every month of the year, let's use expansion to generate the directories systematically.  _Example 46_ demonstrates how to use a _sequence expression_ within a brace expansion to create years, months, and days automatically.

.Using list brace expansion and sequence expansion with the `+mkdir+` command on macOS.
[source, console, caption="Example {counter:listing-counter}: "]
----
chris@ophir ~ % mkdir -p Photography/Shoots/{Arizona,Colorado,New-Mexico,Utah}/{2020..2025}/{01..12}/{01..31}
----

Whoa!  What just happened?  We just generated 9,246 directories that represent each day of each month of the years 2020 to 2025 for each of our photo shoots in the four corner states in the US.  Incredible!  Go ahead and browse the directory structure on your machine to see the results, and let's discuss the sequence expression syntax.  

We first see the `+{2020..2025}+` part of the path.  This cues the shell to create a list of sequential numbers from `+2020+` to `+2025+` and generate sub-directories for each year.  The same syntax is used for the monthly directories, where the `+{01..12}+` sequence tells the shell to create a list of numbers from `+01+` to `+12+` representing the months of the year.  Notice that by adding the zero before the number one (`+01+`), the shell knows to zero-pad all of the single digit months so that all sub-directories are created with two digits.  And lastly, the `+{01..31}+` portion of the path tells the shell to generate a list of daily folders from `+01+` to `+31+` for each daily directory.  Now that is some lightning fast folder creation!

We can now organize our photos into the appropriate directories for the given days and locations that they occured.  While obviously it would be impossible to have a photo shoot of every day of every month for five years, this is an exercise in demonstrating how easy it is to generate a directory structure that suits your needs with just a couple of expansion tools in your toolbox.  You probably also noticed that we generated too many days for many of the months that only have 28, 29, or 30 days in them. We'll have a look at efficiently removing directories in the section on the `+rmdir+` command, but let's first learn to create a backup of our work in case any problems arise.

==== Copying and renaming directories

In our photo shoot scenario, let's say we've added JPEG photo files into the directories that coincide with the dates of our photography shoots.  These include the following locations and dates:

|===

In our scenario, the shoots for 2025 are scheduled but not complete, and so we've created a file called `+reserved.txt+` in each of those date directories as placeholders.

It is a great practice to back up your work before issuing commands that could have big consequences.  As mentioned in _Chapter 3. File Commands_, the `+cp+` command can be used for directories because it has a `+-R+` recursive option.  Let's create a backup of our `+Photography+` directory for safe keeping.  _Example 47_ demonstrates this.

Excellent!  We now have a pristine copy of our `Photography` directory saved to the side to preserve our work.

=== The rmdir Command--Deleting Directories

Removing directories is as easy as creating them, and as we've mentioned, the `+rmdir+` command is our tool of choice.  Go ahead and look at the manual page for the `+rmdir+` command to get to know the command options.  The synopsis states{emdash} "remove empty directories".  The convenient aspect of this command is that it cautiously removes directories, avoiding any directories that have files inside of them.  That can be invaluable!

If we tried to issue a command like `+rmdir Photography+`, based on our knowledge of the command, it wouldn't remove anything because it has sub-directories inside of it, some of which have photo files based on the dates in _Table 3_.  So we want to pass a list of all of the sub-directories as arguments to the `+rmdir+` command, and use the `+-p+` option to evaluate each sub-directory separately.  _Example 48_  uses the same brace expansion in our `+mkdir+` commands previously to generate a list.

CAUTION: While the `+rmdir+` command only removes empty directories, it still permanently removes them.  Be sure of the directories you want to remove.

...
----

So magical!  Let's review what we did here.  First, we used the `+-v+` verbose option so we see which directories were deleted and which were passed over.  The `+-p+` option tells the `+rmdir+` command to evaluate every directory in the given list.  Since the directory path we passed to the command included brace expansion for the state location directories, and sequence expansion for the month and day directories, the `+rmdir+` command evaluated every directory we automatically created earlier with the `+mkdir+` command.  In the end, of the 9,246 directories we generated, it left 102 of them (those with files in them).  Even the directories with invalid days in the months were removed because they had no files in them.  The output in _Example 48_ is truncated for display purposes, but you can see how easy it is to remove empty directories in a very complex directory structure without much work at all.  Thank you `+rmdir+` authors!

==== Know your power

While the `+rmdir+` command is great for mindful removal of undesired empty directories, there are times when you just need to remove an entire directory completely, regardless of what is inside of it.  Of course, we have the power!  As mentioned in _Chapter 3. File Commands_, the `+rm+` command can be used to remove directories.  We are able to do this by using the `+-R+` option, which tells the command to descend into the directory and delete all files and folders. Let's say that our photo shoot scheduled for November of 2025 in New Mexico was canceled, and we need to delete that directory wholesale.  _Example 49_ demonstrates a recursive removal of a directory with the `+rm+` command.

CAUTION: The `+rm -R+` command will instantly delete everything within the directory that is passed in as an argument, so use extreme caution with this command.  Double check that the path is correct, and be aware of mistakes with absolute versus relative paths, or with extra or missing characters.

----
chris@ophir ~ % rm -R Photography/Shoots/New-Mexico/2025
----

And just like that, the `+2025+` directory inside of the `+New-Mexico+` directory is permanently removed with all of its contents.  _Figure 34_ shows the results of this command.

image::chapter-04-macos-remove-directory.png[title="Results of the removal of a sub-directory using the `+rm+` command on macOS.", pdfwidth=100%]

The `+rm -R+` command that we see above can be unforgiving, so be sure use it judiciously!  You may unintentionally have a single character typo in your command which might drastically alter the outcome.  For instance, if we mistakenly introduced a single space character into our command, the result is quite devastating, as shown in _Example 50_.

.Beware of typos!  Inadvertantly removing a directory with a space character typo on macOS.

----

rm: Shoots/New-Mexico/2025/: No such file or directory
----

The above command completed, and promptly removed the entire `+Photography+` directory, and then gave us an error that it could not find a directory named `+Shoots/New-Mexico/2025/+`!  That single space wreaked havoc on our intended command.  The take-home message is of course to double check your work when using this command.  

==== Restoring from a backup

In the event that we did make the single space typo mistake shown in _Example 50_, we can then restore our work by moving our backup directory back to our working `+Photography+` directory, as shown in _Example 51_.

----
chris@ophir ~ % mv Photography-Backup Photography
----

There we go!  We can get back to our work.  In the next section, let's explore the ways we can more precisely identify files and folders, which may allow us to skip the recursive option of the `+rm+` command altogether.

==== Pathname expansion

We see how powerful the recursive use of the `+rm+` command can be, and with mindfullness it is our trusty friend.  Instead of removing directories entirely, we also have the ability to specify patterns of files and folders to remove with a handy concept called _pathname expansion_.  Like brace expansion, the shell will generate a list for us, but in this case, we use special wildcard caharaters in our command.  These include the `+*+` (asterisk, or star), the `+[]+` (square bracket), and the `+?+` (question mark) characters, and are affectionately known as _glob operators_.  Let's discuss these individually.

Let's say that while we were copying our photo files into our directory structure, we mistakenly copied photos taken in Utah from 2020 to 2023 into our `+Colorado+` directories, and that we now need to fix this and re-copy the correct photos into place.  We know our directory dates are correct, so we just need to selectively remove the JPEG files that are currently there.  Let's first use an `+*+` (star) to specify a file pattern to remove, shown in _Example 52_.

CAUTION: Using wildcard patterns with the `+rm+` command will permanently delete the files matching the pattern.  Double check your work, and list the files with the same pattern before removing them.

chris@ophir ~ % rm Photography/Shoots/Colorado/2020/02/10/*jpg
----

Wow! Let's figure out what happended here.  First, we see that there were ten JPEG images in the `+Photography/Shoots/Colorado/2020/02/10/+` directory.  We then used the `+rm+` command with the `+*jpg+` (star wildcard followed by the `+jpg+` file name ending).  This wildcard pattern means "any file name string that ends in jpg".  That is great, and we instantly deleted those ten files.  But we know we have incorrect JPEG images in all of the 2020 to 2023 Colorado sub-directories, so let's explore how we can use square brackets along with the star wildcard to specify the set of files we want to delete.

The `+[]+` bracket syntax lets us specify a list of single characters to match, but if it includes a `+-+` (hyphen), it means a range of characters, and the shell will expand them accordingly.  _Example 53_ uses both the star wildcard and a range of numbers to specify the file paths we would like to remove.

<1> Listing a set of files using a bracketed range and star wildcards
<2> Removing a set of files using a bracketed range and star wildcards

Now that is some precise file name matching!  Let's walk through this command to understand what is happening.  _Figure 35_ illustrates the patterns matched in the command.

image::chapter-04-path-expansion.svg[title="Using pattern matching to enable path expansion in commands on macOS.", pdfwidth=100%]

In _Example 53_ we first use the `+ls+` command to list the files we want to match as a best practice before doing the removal.  The listing is truncated for display purposes, but it has matched eighty files across eight directories.  The bracketed range of `+[0-3]+` expands to the numbers `+0, 1, 2, 3+`, so the pattern matches directories named `+2020, 2021, 2022, 2023+`.  This pattern is followed by `+/*+` star wildcard which will match any directory name (the month directories).  This pattern is followed by another `+/*+` star wildcard which also matches any directory name (the daily directories).  Lastly, the `+*jpg+` star wildcard will match any file names ending in `+jpg+`.  That's it!  In one powerful command, we have removed the incorrect images from Utah that were placed into our Colorado directories, and we can now replace them with the correct images.

To round out our pathname expansion toolkit, let's discuss the `+?+` wildcard.  This character matches any single character.  So for instance, in the case of our JPEG photo names, a pattern of `+IMG_???.jpg+` would match any of our image files given how they were named (for example, `+IMG_411.jpg+`).  

There are many other ways to use the various expansion techniques on the command line to make quick work.  They are documented in the `+bash+` and `+zsh+` manual pages (i.e `man bash`).  Just search for the `+EXPANSION+` section, and in particular the `+Pathname Expansion+` sub-section to learn about these little gems!  But next, let's learn how to get a good grasp on how much disk space we are using in our subdirectories so we can easily manage old, forgotten, and often huge files that are no longer needed.  The `+du+` command is a real eye opener!

=== The du Command--Viewing Disk Usage

We all have many different files we have created or downloaded and that are no longer needed.  When we look at the amount of space left on our storage drives, it seems like we can free up a lot of space if we knew where the unwanted files were located in our file system.  The `+du+` command lets us display our "disk usage" in a number of ways so we can discover where those huge files are located, or just get a sense of where a lot of smaller files are adding up.  Let's have a look at the `+du+` command in the context of our Photography directory.  Without a directory argument, the `+du+` command will calculate usage in your current working directory.  _Example 54_ demonstrates the command with only the `+-h+` option to tell it to print human-readable file and directory sizes.

The listing in _Example 54_ has been truncated for display purposes, but we can see that the `+du+` command has traversed the entire `Photography` directory tree, and has calculated a total size of each sub-directory.  It's really fast!  We get a look at how big the directories are, and there is a grand total at the end for the `+.+` (dot) current directory.  We see that there are zero bytes in many of the Colorado directories because we recently deleted all of those files in years 2020 to 2023.  This command is perfect for directory trees that are moderately sized, but when you have deeply nested directories, you might want to look at a shorter summary to see where the biggest files are.  We have the magic!  _Example 55_ shows the `+du+` command with the `+-s+` option which will summarize the directories given as arguments.

Ah, so simple!  We used a `+*+` star wildcard in our relative directory path such that each sub-directory (the four corners states) would each be summarized.

<1> An errant file downloaded into a deeply nested directory

Ah hah!  It looks like there is a mistakenly downloaded Davinci Resolve application installer deep inside the `+Photography+` directory.  We can use the `+rm+` command to remove that file, as we learned about in _Chapter 3. File Commands_.  And with that, we've completed our short tour of the `+du+` command, which can be very helpful in discovering what exactly is buried in your file system.  Feel free to read the manual page for the `+du+` command since there are other useful options to help you with managing your directories.

=== Command Line Folder Handling is Awesome!

While this chapter features only a few commands, they are a total power house when it comes to managing files and directories at lightning speeds.  We are now familiar with the ultra-handy `+mkdir+` command, which allows us to generate entire folder structures with a very compact syntax.  When we couple it with the concept of brace expansion, we can automatically generate directory trees with ease.  We are also now acquainted with its sister command of `+rmdir+`, which helps us keep our directories neat and free of unneccessary empty directories. The combination of these two commands allows us to organize our files in ways that are not possible using graphical tools, particularly when using our pathname wildcard expansion techniques.  In addition, we now know our power when it comes to wholesale deletion of directories using the recursive option of the `+rm+` command.  As an insurance policy when using the recursive `+rm+` command, we now have solid strategies to backup and restore our work using the `+cp+` and `+mv+` commands.  The more we use our systems, the more chances there are for files that are unneeded or obsolete over time.  To that end, we've learned that the `+du+` command is a powerful way to understand what is taking up our disk space, and we now have the power to trim things down!  What a whirlwind!  In the next chapter we will continue to discover how command line file management is at our fingertips, with a focus on data-oriented commands that let us delve inside of files.  We're heading to the stars!
